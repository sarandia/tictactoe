The communication protocol of my Tic-Tac-Toe game is:
1. In this description of the protocol, Player1 is defined as the player who joins the group first; Player2 is defined as the player who joins the group later.
2. When Player2 joins an existing group and the group becomes full (2/2, this should be done automatically), Player2's client sends "MSG,@group_name,Start Game!" to Player1.
3. Player1 receives "Start Game" and makes the first placement. The player who places his piece first is assigned with "X" and the other gets assigned "O".
4. Each time a player makes a placement, his client sends out "MSG,@group_name,Move*(x,y)" where x and y represent the coordinate of the placement. Right after the message is sent,
   the board of the player sending the message is updated accordingly and is disabled to wait for the other player.
5. When the other player receives a message containing the coordinate the opponent just placed his piece, his board is updated and activated for his action. After he makes the placement,
   his board is disabled. Every time a player receives a new placement from the opponent, a check is performed to determine if the opponent has won the game.
6. If the check confirms that the opponent has won, the client will display "You Lost" and send a message "MSG,@group_name,You Won!" to the opponent. The board will be disabled.
7. When received "You Won!", the board will be disabled and the text "You Won" will be displayed.
